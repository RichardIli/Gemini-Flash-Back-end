## Gemini API-Powered Server ‚ú®

This is a simple Node.js server that leverages the Gemini API to provide two main functionalities:

1. Recipe Generation: Generate recipe ideas based on ingredients, categories, or as a daily suggestion.

2. Bonsai Auction Item Generation: Generate a list of bonsai items for a hypothetical auction.

3. The server uses Express for routing and is configured to handle API requests and responses.
